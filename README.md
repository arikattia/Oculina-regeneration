# Investigating Regeneration Following Stress In Mediterranean Coral Oculina Patagonica
## Introduction
Tissue regeneration is essential for restoring structure and function after injury. In corals, it plays a critical role in surviving environmental stress. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this process remain unclear. This study uses oculina patagonica to explore how stress triggers regeneration, aiming to shed light on pathways that support coral resilience.

## My research aim
To investigate the regenerative process in O. Patagonica following stress exposure, focusing on the role of stem-like cells (cells with regenerative potential) and metabolic responses (chemical processes aiding recovery)
## Experimental design
